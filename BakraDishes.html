    <p>  An establishment that prepares and
         serves food and beverages to patrons is a restaurant.
         
        Although many restaurants also provide takeout and food delivery services,
         meals are typically served and consumed on the premises.
          Restaurants range widely in terms of design and offers, 
          serving a broad range of cuisines and service styles from low-cost
           cafeterias and fast-food joints to mid-range family eateries and 
           expensive luxury venues. </p>
